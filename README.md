# jsandcsscompressor
Simple compressor and summer for html websites based on  matthiasmullie/minify

The speed of a website is becoming increasingly important. Therefore, all loaded CSS and JS files should always be as compressed as possible. Also, as less as possible should be loaded of both types, preferably only one.
Now it would be pointless to write all code in a file, because then this can become incredibly large.
This project was created so that only one file has to be loaded, and yet it is not too big, because the server assembles a minimized file from all necessary files. This works for both JS and CSS files.
